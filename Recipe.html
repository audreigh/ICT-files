<div><p align= justify> <b>Sinigang na Bangus</b> is a type of sour clear broth fish soup. This recipe that we have here is basic, but it is my favorite among all the versions that I have tried. 
My family likes this too because it is simple and delicious. You can really enjoy the fresh taste of the fish complemented by the warm sour broth. <b>Sinigang na bangus</b> is best served with warm rice. I also like to eat it using fish sauce as a condiment. 
Simply pour some fish sauce in a saucer and add a few pieces of chili pepper.</p></div>
