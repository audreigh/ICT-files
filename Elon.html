<h1>Elon Musk accuses Apple of threatening to remove Twitter from App Store</h1>




<p><b>New York

CNN Business</b>

 — 

Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has “threatened” to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion.

<br><br>

“<i>Apple <u>(AAPL)</u> has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why,</i>” Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple <u>(AAPL)</u> and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter’s business.

<br><br>

In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. “<em>Do they hate free speech in America</em>,” he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. “<i>What’s going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?</i>” Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple’s size, <u>claimed</u> it engages in “censorship,” and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.

<br><br>

In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know “<i>Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?</i>” In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward “<em>pay 30%,</em>” the other pointed toward “<em>go to war.</em>” An old car labeled “<em>Elon</em>” skidded toward the latter.</p>
